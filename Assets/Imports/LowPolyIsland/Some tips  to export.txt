- Export FBX from Blender to Unity.


If you have a lot of objects in Blender and U want to export correctly to Unity (this means all objects are scaled in Unity = 1), you should select "Selected Objects" and "Apply Transform" in Blender options.


- For mobile games.

For mobile games it's recommended to change the material shader in Unity to "mobile/diffused" type.
